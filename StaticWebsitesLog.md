# Static Websites Tutorial Log: Oct 13, 2021
Started by following the demo of the [Static Websites Tutorial](https://graddh.netlify.app/docs/tutorials/static-websites/) from the course website. Fairly straight forward and fun to see the text "come to life" as a website!
To do so 
1. Create a new **public** repo on github named merandagp.github.io, I forgot to name it with my username the first time which meant that my url was ridiculously long 
2. Don't forget to add the readme file to initialize the repo
3. Then create a new index.md file (I think .html file would also work but I'm def not there yet) this will be the home for the code of the website
3. Click on the gear/settings section and scroll down to the "pages" part
4. Here I picked my branch, which was "main" and in the folder "root"
5. Themes can be chosen in the step just underneath that, I liked Cayman the best 
6. Then the website publishes [here](https://merandagp.github.io/) RAD!

I also explored some of the example sites that github shares on this [page](https://github.com/collections/github-pages-examples) and found [this](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages) page to be helpful for understanding how pages works. I also have a feeling this [course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/github-pages) by github could be helpful

## Next Steps 
I want to explore what is and how to use [site generator](https://gohugo.io/) that's suggested in the tutorial and customize a landing page.

Tried to add a [hugo template](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-resume/) but got very confused by how to install and run hugo on my machine. I attempted to just download a template from hugo and upload the template unzipped file to my repo and it didn't work (but to be fair, I definitely was not following the Hugo instructions). 

After getting discouraged by Hugo, I started looking into the built in site generator on github called  Jekyll and swiched my themes a bunch of times. I settled on Tactile for now. 

I ended up changing around some of the content in the index.md file for customization and added an about.md file for fun.
